# Development Log

## 2025-07-12

### Initial Setup and Enhancements

*   **Cloned Repository**: Cloned the `AstronomyDashboard` repository to begin development.
*   **Default Dark Mode**: Modified `index.html` to set dark mode as the default theme upon loading, enhancing initial user experience.
*   **Added NASA Image and Video Library Search Section**: Integrated a new section in `index.html` allowing users to search for images and videos from the NASA Image and Video Library. This involved adding input fields, a search button, and a display area for results.
*   **Added Interactive Star Chart Section**: Included a placeholder section for an interactive star chart in `index.html`. This section is designed to display a star chart based on the user's location, with a refresh button. (Note: Actual star chart rendering requires external API or library integration, which is a future enhancement).
*   **Cleaned up `index.html`**: Removed redundant dark mode initialization code, hardcoded celestial events from the HTML structure, and unnecessary placeholder comments to streamline the codebase and improve readability.

### Feature Additions

*   **Mars Rover Photos Integration**: Added a new section and JavaScript functionality to fetch and display the latest photos from NASA's Mars Rovers (Curiosity).
*   **EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) Images Integration**: Added a new section and JavaScript functionality to fetch and display daily images of Earth from NASA's EPIC camera.
*   **Enhanced Near Earth Objects (NEOs) Display**: Modified the NEOs section to include more detailed information such as relative velocity and a direct link to the NASA JPL Small-Body Database for each object.

### Next Steps

*   **Dynamic Celestial Events Fetching**: Implemented dynamic fetching of Solar Flares (FLR) and Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) using NASA's DONKI API, replacing the static list.
*   **Interactive Star Chart Integration**: Integrated `d3-celestial` library to render an interactive star chart based on user's location, displaying stars, constellations, and other celestial objects.
*   **UI/UX Refinements**: Added CSS styling for Mars Rover Photos and EPIC Images sections to ensure visual consistency. Increased the height of the star chart for better visibility.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling and User Feedback**: Implemented loading messages, specific error messages, and fallback mechanisms (e.g., caching) for API calls (APOD, ISS, NEOs, Mars Rover Photos, EPIC Images) to improve user experience during data fetching.
